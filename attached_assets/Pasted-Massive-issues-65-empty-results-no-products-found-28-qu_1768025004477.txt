Good - at least empty results are flagged. Now let me create the summary:Creating analysis of the full audit resultsSUNNY_AUDIT_FULL_ANALYSIS.mdPresented fileIt's Worse Than I Thought
The Numbers:

734 PASS / 0 FAIL - audit is useless, wrong results pass
66 INVENTORY_GAP - major brands missing
Same product returned 28+ times for unrelated queries


NEW Major Problems Found:
1. Substring Matching Disaster:
QueryGotWhy"bike for kids"Boucle Biker Coat"bik" matched "biker""skateboard for kids"Skateboarding Book"bowling party"Bowling Shoes"cheap toys""Dirty Deeds Done Cheap" T-shirt
2. Major Brands MISSING (zero results):

nerf, roblox, sylvanian families
playdough, aquabeads, jenga
pampers, huggies, tommee tippee, calpol
legoland, chessington, longleat, cadbury world

3. Wrong Gender:

"school shoes boys" → Girls Skirt (!)


The Core Problem:
Search is doing:
sqlWHERE title LIKE '%bike%'   -- matches "biker" coat
Should be doing:
sqlWHERE title REGEXP '\bbike\b'  -- only matches "bike" as word

Fix Priority:
TODAY:

Word boundary matching (bike ≠ biker)
Add missing brand inventory

THIS WEEK:
3. Age filtering
4. Character must-match
5. Diversity limits
Full analysis in the doc. This isn't tuning - the search architecture is broken.
