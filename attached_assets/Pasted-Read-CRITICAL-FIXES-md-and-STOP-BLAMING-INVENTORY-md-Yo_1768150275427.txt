Read CRITICAL_FIXES.md and STOP_BLAMING_INVENTORY.md.

FIX #60-69 - You logged these, verify they're working

After checking, give me a table:
| Fix # | Feature | Status | File:Line or MISSING |

Update CRITICAL_FIXES.md with the COMPLETE fix history from #1 to #69.

This is critical - we need to know what's actually built vs just discussed.
