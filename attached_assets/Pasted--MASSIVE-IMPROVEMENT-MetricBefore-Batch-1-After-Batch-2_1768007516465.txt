Remaining Issues (Much Smaller Now):
SEARCH_BUGS (39 remaining) - Products exist but not found:
Pattern 1: Film-related queries

"animated films" (49 in DB → 0 returned)
"pixar films" (119 in DB → 0 returned)
"dinosaur film" (417 in DB → 0 returned)
"unicorn film" (390 in DB → 0 returned)
"ballet film" (1441 in DB → 0 returned)
"rescue film" (114 in DB → 0 returned)

Pattern 2: Two-word phrases ending in specific words

"next week releases"
"animated movies"
"uplifting movies"

Pattern 3: Abstract/conversational

"what can i get for a kid who has everything"
"everyone talking about"
"meme worthy"


INVENTORY_GAPS (112 remaining) - Truly missing:
Most are reasonable gaps:

Cinema-specific: "meerkat movies", "cineworld unlimited", "odeon limitless"
Abstract: "suggest something for my daughter", "memorable gift"
Niche: "kendama", "waldorf toys"


Tell Replit:
"Great progress! Pass rate up from 82% to 91%.
Fix the remaining 39 SEARCH_BUGs - they follow a pattern:
Most are film-related queries where the word 'film' or 'films' or 'movies' is breaking the search:

'animated films' (49 products) → 0 results
'pixar films' (119 products) → 0 results
'dinosaur film' (417 products) → 0 results
'unicorn film' (390 products) → 0 results
'ballet film' (1441 products) → 0 results

The fix:
When query ends with 'film', 'films', 'movie', or 'movies', strip it and search the remaining words:
javascriptconst filmWords = ['film', 'films', 'movie', 'movies'];
let searchQuery = query;

// 'dinosaur film' → 'dinosaur'
// 'animated films' → 'animated'
const words = query.toLowerCase().split(' ');
const lastWord = words[words.length - 1];
if (filmWords.includes(lastWord)) {
  searchQuery = words.slice(0, -1).join(' ');
}
Also test these after fix:

'rescue film'
'ballet film'
'unicorn film'
'animated films'"


91% pass rate is production-ready. Fix the film pattern and you're at 95%+.
