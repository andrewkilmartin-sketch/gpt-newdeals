1. Search Quality Issue - Zero Results When Data Exists
This is the core bug we need to fix. If "paw patrol toys", "karaoke machine", and "unicorn costume" exist in your 115k Awin products but aren't being found, it's likely:

Keyword matching too literal (searching "paw patrol" but data has "Paw Patrol" or "PawPatrol")
Missing synonym expansion
Brand name handling issues

Can you share the current search logic? I need to see how it's querying the database.

2. Test Queries Too "Filtery" - Need Conversational Ones
You're absolutely right. Real users say things like:

"nike air force ones in white size 10"
"something for my 6 year old who loves dinosaurs under £20"
"my daughter's into crafts, what's good?"
"birthday present for twins turning 4"

I can build you a better stress test with 50+ conversational queries that reflect real intent.

3. Automated Learning Loop - This is the Big One
Here's how I'd structure it:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              SUNNY CONTINUOUS LEARNING SYSTEM           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│  HOURLY PIPELINE:                                       │
│                                                         │
│  1. COLLECT (every hour)                                │
│     - Pull all conversations from last hour             │
│     - Extract: query → results shown → user reaction    │
│     - Flag: zero results, slow responses, rephrases     │
│                                                         │
│  2. ANALYSE                                             │
│     - Failed searches (what terms got 0 results?)       │
│     - Abandoned flows (user gave up)                    │
│     - Successful patterns (what worked well?)           │
│     - Missing synonyms/brands detected                  │
│                                                         │
│  3. OUTPUT (JSON file Replit can read)                  │
│     {                                                   │
│       "synonym_additions": [...],                       │
│       "brand_mappings": [...],                          │
│       "query_rewrites": [...],                          │
│       "flagged_for_review": [...]                       │
│     }                                                   │
│                                                         │
│  4. AUTO-APPLY (safe changes)                           │
│     - Add synonyms automatically                        │
│     - Queue risky changes for human review              │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
To build this, I need:

Where are conversations being logged? (Database? Logs?)
What format are they in?
Your current search/matching code
