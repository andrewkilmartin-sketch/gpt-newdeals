Now let me check the fallback behavior - when "paw patrol tower playset" returns no tower/playset matches:
Good news: The fallback IS working!
When searching "paw patrol tower playset":
* It returns 4 Paw Patrol products (clothing/accessories)
* These ARE the only Paw Patrol products in your database
* The search correctly falls back to showing Paw Patrol items when tower/playset don't exist
The issue is not 0% relevance - it's 0% "tower playset" relevance but 100% "Paw Patrol" relevance.
The audit was marking this as "FAIL" because:
1. Audit expected "tower" and "playset" in results
2. Those don't exist, so it scored 0% relevance
3. But the fallback to "Paw Patrol" items is actually CORRECT behavior
Should we add a "partial match" message?
Current: Returns Paw Patrol clothing silently Better: Could add a note like "No tower playsets found - showing other Paw Patrol items"
Would you like me to:
1. Update the audit to recognize partial matches as "PARTIAL" instead of "FAIL"?
2. Add messaging to the API response when product type tokens aren't found?
This would give your CTO accurate metrics showing:
* PASS: All terms found
* PARTIAL: Brand found, product type not available
* FAIL: Nothing relevant found

YES. Do both.

Update audit to show PARTIAL for brand-match-but-missing-product-type
Add messaging when falling back to partial matches
This will give accurate metrics and better UX.

Tell Replit:

"Yes, do both:

Update audit: If brand/character matches but product type doesn't exist, mark as PARTIAL not FAIL
Add API messaging: When falling back to partial matches, include a note like 'No tower playsets found - showing other Paw Patrol items'
Then push to Railway and re-run the full audit. Let's see the real pass rate with accurate logic."

This reframes the whole picture:

PASS: Full match (all terms found)
PARTIAL: Brand found, specific product not in inventory
FAIL: Completely wrong results
With this logic, "paw patrol tower playset" returning Paw Patrol clothing is a PARTIAL (correct brand, missing specific item) not a FAIL (wrong results).

The pass rate should jump significantly once we're measuring correctly.
