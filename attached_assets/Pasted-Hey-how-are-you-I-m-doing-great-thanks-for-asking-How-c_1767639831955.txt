Ok great also need some Chester zoo tickets
You can certainly get tickets for Chester Zoo! It's a fantastic day out where you can learn about conservation and see a wide variety of animals. Tickets are typically £42.50 for adults and £30 for children.

For extra savings, consider using Kids Pass, which saves you up to 40% on zoo tickets. Check it out here: Kids Pass - Zoos.

While you're planning your visit, you might want to grab some binoculars so you can get a good look at the animals. I found this set for £31.99 from Zavvi: LEGO Star Wars Binoculars Set.

Also, consider getting a fun animal-themed toy to keep the excitement going at home! I found the "Friends Farm Animal Vet Clinic" for £29.99 at Debenhams: Animal Vet Clinic Set.
