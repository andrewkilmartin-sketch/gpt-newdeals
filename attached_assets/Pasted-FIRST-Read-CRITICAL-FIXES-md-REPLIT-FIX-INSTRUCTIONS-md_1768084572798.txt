FIRST: Read CRITICAL_FIXES.md, REPLIT_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md, and STOP_BLAMING_INVENTORY.md. Tell me what fixes are already logged before doing anything.
Then check these queries LIVE (not cached) and tell me what you see:
	1.	train set
	2.	hot wheels
	3.	water gun
	4.	super soaker
	5.	ipad case for kids
	6.	badminton set
PROBLEMS FROM AUDIT:
“train set” returns Nike trainers and Training tops instead of toy trains. Word boundary bug - “train” matching “trainer”.
“hot wheels” returns Pyjamas £18, Wellies £17, Track Pants £26.99, Calendar £13.99. Zero actual toy cars.
“water gun” returns Waterproof jackets. No water guns.
“super soaker” returns 0 results but DB has 8413 products. Search is broken, NOT inventory gap.
“ipad case for kids” returns Bookcases and Murder mystery books. “case” matching “bookcase”.
“badminton set” returns NosiBotanical Vest again. This product appears for 20+ unrelated queries.
FIXES NEEDED:
Fix #29: Word boundary - “train” should not match “trainer” or “training”
Fix #30: Hot wheels should return toy cars not clothing
Fix #31: Block NosiBotanical Vest product - investigate why it matches everything
Fix #32: “case” should not match “bookcase”
Fix #33: super soaker returning 0 when 8413 products exist in DB
DEBUG SQL TO RUN:
SELECT name, category FROM products WHERE name ILIKE ‘%hot wheels%’ AND category NOT ILIKE ‘%cloth%’ LIMIT 10;
SELECT name FROM products WHERE name ILIKE ‘%super soaker%’ LIMIT 10;
SELECT name FROM products WHERE name ILIKE ‘%train%’ AND name NOT ILIKE ‘%trainer%’ AND name NOT ILIKE ‘%training%’ LIMIT 10;
AFTER EACH FIX:
	1.	Update CRITICAL_FIXES.md with fix number, problem, root cause, solution, file and line numbers, test query
	2.	Update STOP_BLAMING_INVENTORY.md if you discover products exist that you thought were missing
	3.	Run regression tests
	4.	Do not move to next fix until current fix passes tests
DO NOT BLAME INVENTORY. We have 1.5 million products. If search returns 0, your search logic is broken. Prove products don’t exist with SQL before claiming inventory gap.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
