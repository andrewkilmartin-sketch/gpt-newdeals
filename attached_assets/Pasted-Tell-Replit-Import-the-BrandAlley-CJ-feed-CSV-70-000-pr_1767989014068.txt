Tell Replit:

"Import the BrandAlley CJ feed CSV (70,000 products). Here's the spec:
1. IMPORT REQUIREMENTS
javascript// Map CJ CSV fields to our products table
const mapCJProduct = (row) => ({
  id: `cj_${row.id || row.product_id}`,  // Prefix with cj_ to avoid Awin conflicts
  name: row.title || row.product_name,
  description: row.description,
  affiliateLink: row.link || row.deep_link,
  imageUrl: row.image_link || row.image_url,
  price: parseFloat((row.price || '0').toString().replace(/[^0-9.]/g, '')),
  brand: row.brand || 'BrandAlley',
  merchant: 'BrandAlley UK',
  merchantId: 'cj_brandalley',
  category: row.google_product_category || row.product_type || row.category,
  inStock: row.availability === 'in_stock' || row.availability === 'in stock' || true,
  source: 'cj'  // CRITICAL: Mark as CJ product
});
2. VALIDATION

Skip rows with no title/name
Skip rows with no price or price = 0
Skip rows with no affiliate link
Log how many skipped vs imported

3. INSERT TO NEON

Use batch inserts (500-1000 at a time for speed)
Use ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE to handle duplicates
Insert into the SAME products table as Awin products

4. AFTER IMPORT, VERIFY
sql-- Check counts by source
SELECT source, COUNT(*) as count FROM products GROUP BY source;

-- Check BrandAlley specifically
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE merchant = 'BrandAlley UK';

-- Sample some products
SELECT name, price, brand, source FROM products WHERE source = 'cj' LIMIT 10;
```

### 5. TEST SEARCH WORKS

Search should now return both Awin AND CJ products:
```
GET /api/shopping/search?q=hugo+boss
GET /api/shopping/search?q=sunglasses
Both should return BrandAlley CJ products mixed with Awin products.
6. ENSURE RAILWAY USES SAME DATABASE
Confirm the Neon DATABASE_URL in Railway matches Replit - both must point to the same database so Railway sees the new CJ products.

Start the import and show me:

How many products imported successfully
How many skipped (and why)
The SQL count by source
A test search for 'hugo boss'"
