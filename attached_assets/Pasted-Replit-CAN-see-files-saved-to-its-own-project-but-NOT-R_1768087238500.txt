Replit CAN see files saved to its own project, but NOT Railway production.
The solution: Run audits on Replit localhost, not Railway. Same code, same database - Replit can then read its own results and learn.
Here's the full instructions for Replit:

Read CRITICAL_FIXES.md, REPLIT_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md, and STOP_BLAMING_INVENTORY.md. Tell me what fixes are logged.
I want to set up an automated audit and fix loop that runs on Replit, not Railway. You can see files saved to this project, so let's use that.
BUILD THIS SYSTEM:
Step 1: Create scripts/auto-audit-learn.ts
This script should:

Run 200 test queries against localhost (not Railway)
Save results to data/audit-results-latest.csv
Group failures by pattern type:

WORD_BOUNDARY (train→trainer, case→bookcase)
CLOTHING_LEAK (toys returning pyjamas, jackets)
WRONG_CATEGORY (ipad case→bookcase)
BLOCKED_PRODUCT (NosiBotanical appearing)
ZERO_RESULTS (products exist but search returns 0)
INVENTORY_GAP (genuinely no products)


Output summary like:

  AUDIT COMPLETE: 200 queries
  PASS: 150 (75%)
  FAIL: 50 (25%)
  
  Failure patterns:
  - WORD_BOUNDARY: 15 failures
  - CLOTHING_LEAK: 12 failures
  - WRONG_CATEGORY: 10 failures
  - ZERO_RESULTS: 8 failures
  - INVENTORY_GAP: 5 failures
  
  Top 5 failing queries:
  1. train set - WORD_BOUNDARY - returns trainers
  2. hot wheels - CLOTHING_LEAK - returns pyjamas
  ...
Step 2: Create scripts/fix-pattern.ts
This script should:

Take a pattern type as argument (e.g. WORD_BOUNDARY)
Show all queries failing with that pattern
Suggest fix based on pattern type
After you implement fix, re-run audit to measure improvement

Step 3: The Loop
After every fix:

Run npx tsx scripts/auto-audit-learn.ts
Check if failure count decreased
Pick next biggest pattern
Fix it
Repeat

TARGET: Get from current ~75% pass rate to 95%+ pass rate
This way you can see your own results, identify patterns, and measure improvement after each fix. No need for me to upload files - you read your own audit results.
Start by building auto-audit-learn.ts. Test it works by running against localhost. Show me the first output summary.
Update CRITICAL_FIXES.md with Fix #37 - Automated Audit Learning Loop.
Also fix "water gun" returning bouncy castles while you're at it - log as Fix #36.
