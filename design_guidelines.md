# API-Only Project - No Frontend Design Required

## Project Context
This is a **backend API service** designed to provide data endpoints for a custom ChatGPT integration. The project consists solely of REST API endpoints with no user-facing web interface.

## No Design Guidelines Needed
Since this project has:
- No web pages or user interface
- No visual components
- Only programmatic API endpoints called by ChatGPT
- JSON-only responses

**Visual design guidelines are not applicable.**

## What This Project Requires Instead

### API Design Principles
1. **Clear JSON Response Structure** - Consistent, well-formatted response objects
2. **Comprehensive Documentation** - OpenAPI/Swagger spec for ChatGPT integration
3. **Error Handling** - Standardized error response formats
4. **CORS Configuration** - Proper headers for ChatGPT access

### Optional Admin/Documentation Interface
If you later decide to add:
- An API documentation page (like Swagger UI)
- An admin dashboard to manage data
- A testing interface

Then design guidelines would be necessary. For now, focus on robust API architecture and clear endpoint specifications.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with backend implementation. Design guidelines can be generated if/when a frontend component is added to the project.
